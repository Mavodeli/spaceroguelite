Ending: give the cure to the colony
Text: You arrived on Cryke 2H23 just in time. You decided against entering cryo sleep again for the journey back home, out of fear that you wouldn't wake up again. As a result, the head ache steadily worsened and halfway along the flight you lost all feeling in the infected arm, to the point where you were unable to even lift it up, let alone steer the ship with it. Once you finally entered Cryke's atmosphere, the claw had begun to involuntarily snap at everything around it and by the time they dragged you out of your cockpit you had completely lost any sense of your body and your limbs were thrashing uncontrollably. Shortly after that, you lost consciousness.


Ending: take the cure yourself
Text: You open the little yellow strongbox with the evil-looking pictogram. Inside lies a small phial with a strangely blue-ish glowing liquid. 'Well, that's quite convenient!' you think as you uncork it and chug the potion. Immediately you start choking and the infected arm begins thrashing violently. Your throat feels as if you just drank fluid fire and it takes all the willpower you can muster to force the liquid down your gullet. After the most agonizing two minutes of your life the pain finally resides. You might just be imagining it but looking down at your arm you notice that the red swellings appear way smaller than before. Out of curiosity you try to use the parasite's telekinetic ability to push the yellow box away from you and while you still manage to hurl it across the cargo hold of your ship, it certainly responds much more sluggish to your will. Satisfied, you cross the few paces to the cockpit and strap yourself into the flight seat. Of course you are not rid of the parasite yet, but you can't help but feel much more at ease that in a long time as you go through the preflight-check.
