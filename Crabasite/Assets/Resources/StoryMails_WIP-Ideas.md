Content: Hey, just wanted to let you know how things are over here :) Not that great actually. The experimental treatments do not seem to have any effect on the parasite so far. Still more and more people are getting sick every day, this morning admin has announced that the housing blocks B and D will be entirely put under quarantine. That's nearly half the colony! Also, at work the management finally decided to comply with the emergency regulations, so now we have to enter the office through those decontamination chambers. It's not as much of a hassle as you might think, the procedure is much like passing an air lock. Anyway, guess that's it for now, how are YOU doing? ...No seriously, get back to me as soon as you read this, I'm kinda starting to worry... Love you!

Content: Something strange happened yesterday at the office: around lunch time the head secretary suddenly collapsed right in the middle of a call, limbs thrashing, drooling like crazy, eyes rolling back and everything! Of course that was it for the day, security immediately rushed in, took them to the medical center and everyone who was working in the office at that time was sent home and put under quarantine for two weeks. So, guess I'll be working from home now... Let me tell you, 'home office' hasn't even started, yet I already hate everything about it! Just getting the router to let me use the company's vpn was a real pain but setting up the input pass-through from my keyboard to the cloud hypervisor... I just wish you were here, you're way better with this IT stuff. Also, now that I'm home all the time, X [the kid] is pulling my sleeve like every five minutes, it's so exhausting but I can't call Judy over bc we're technically under quarantine. So yeah, that's how it is right now... Please get this mission done as soon as possible, we need you here. I need you.

Subject: REMINDER: Submit your mission report
Content: It has been several days since your last mission report. Please submit an up-to-date report detailing your current progress at your earliest convenience. Sincerely, Qarea, Chief Scientist on Cryke 2H23 on behalf of the Ministry of Medical Affairs. PS: As you know, when the ministry asks you to submit something 'at your earliest convenience' that this means 'immediately'. I don't care if you are currently having supper or if you are being chased by a Tenebrian destroyer, start writing that report! Also, should you have retrieved the cure by now and are deliberately delaying your return, you will have to explain yourself before an imperial court martial, do I make myself clear?

Content: It is kind of embarrassing to admit but... I don't get much sleep at the moment. Every night I'm having these thoughts like 'What if something happened to you?' What if you don't come back? Would I be able to care for X all by myself? I know how silly that sounds! You know I'm not the anxious type, I myself have no idea where this is suddenly coming from. It's just... It's been days and you still haven't answered any of my messages, y'know? I've already been to the doctor and he prescribed me some pills that should help me sleep so I guess I'll be fine for now... Oh, before I forget: X asked me to include one of [their] drawings. In case it's not apparent, it is supposed to depict you fighting off a bunch of Tenebrians. Cute right?

Content: X has fallen ill. They took [them] to the medical center this morning. [They were] constantly coughing for two days now and began complaining about head ache and nausea yesterday evening. The doctor said it is likely another parasite infection. I am little fatigued myself since I came back home and my shoulder blades feel somewhat stiff, dunno if it's just stress or if I caught something... if it doesn't get better by tomorrow I'll make an appointment for a check-up. I'm begging you, please just get this mission done and come back, I really need you here with me. It's just so much at the moment, I don't know if I'll be able to bear it all...

Content: Hey there! I just wanted to let you know that the medication they developed from the cure sample you brought back from the [Asclepius] is working great. X responded really well to the treatment, [they were] among the first to receive a dose. By now [they are] as good as new and I'm on the mend as well. [They are] asking about you all the time. Yeah, I haven't told [them] yet. I know I shouldn't put it off like that, I... guess I still haven't completely come to terms with it myself. It feels so unreal y'know? Like, I always imagined the three of us would get through all of this together. That we would live our lives together. I suppose I haven't fully realised that... yeah, that that's it. You're gone, You have moved on without me. And the last thing you did was to save all of us... I'm not even sure I deserve that kind of sacrifice. Anyway, I don't want to end this message on such a heavy note :) I hope you're doing well, where ever you are right now. I hope this other place is nice and that you are happy. I think I should wrap it up for now so... if you can and if it's not too much to ask, wait for me. I wish for us to be reunited again someday, I really do. And if only to tell you about all the things happened in your absence, about how X grew up, how [they] did in school, about the first partner [they] brought home and so on. But for now... so long!

Content: For your service to His Imperial Highness in retrieving a cure for the parasite infection that plaques the imperial colony on Cryke 2H23, the Ministry of Medical Affairs has been granted permission and is most pleased to bestow the title of 'Honorary Colonial Subject' upon you. You have furthermore been granted permission to purchase residential property in the Imperial City. To claim the certificate signed by the High Secretary herself and the monetary compensation that come with your new civil status, please visit your Legal Supervisor at your convenience. Sincerely, Qarea, Chief Scientist on Cryke 2H23 on behalf of the Ministry of Medical Affairs. PS: I'm very sorry that on account of your physical condition we cannot meet in person and I hope that this message finds you in a state where you are still able to comprehend its meaning. Your [wife] passed away half an hour ago. The treatment sadly didn't do much to contain the parasite, the infection had already spread too far by the time you returned with the cure. According to [her] wishes, we will scatter her cremated remains outside of Cryke's atmosphere, as we did with those of your child. Since you do not have any relative eligible to inherit your possessions left, they will be assimilated into colonial property upon your passing.
