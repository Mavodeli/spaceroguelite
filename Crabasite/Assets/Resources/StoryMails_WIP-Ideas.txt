Content: Hey, just wanted to let you know how things are over here :) Not that great actually. The experimental treatments do not seem to have any effect on the parasite so far. Still more and more people are getting sick every day, this morning admin has announced that the housing blocks B and D will be entirely put under quarantine. That's nearly half the colony! Also, at work the management finally decided to comply with the emergency regulations, so now we have to enter the office through those decontamination chambers. It's not as much of a hassle as you might think, the procedure is much like passing an air lock. Anyway, guess that's it for now, how are YOU doing? ...No seriously, get back to me as soon as you read this, I'm kinda starting to worry... Love you!
