Scene: Entering the abandoned spaceship for the first time. New e-mails are coming through.

MC: Oh, the back hole must've interfered with reception.

MC: What the hell happened to this thing. Nobody came to pick them up or get them out of open space. I hope that was because they didn't insure this transport, not because of something more dangerous. Like those stories about crazy parasites taking over a whole crew and now they are just floating around in space... ... sigh.

Scene: Emergency door with ultimate

MC: Shit, how do I get through? I don't have a code or anything. Maybe I should try '1234' or 'password'... ... Alright, that would've been too good to be true.
AI: Emergency door locked. Ship under attack. Leave or I will make you.
MC: Nonono! Wait a minute. I'm not trying to attack anything! How are you even still functioning, this ship has been floating in space for weeks!
AI: Intruder. Intruder. Leave or I will make you.
MC: I have to get through this door and find the cure as fast as possible or this AI will be my end.

Scene: Emergency door without ultimate.

MC: Shit, how do I get through? I don't have a code or anything. Maybe I should try '1234' or 'password'... ... Alright, that would've been too good to be true.
AI: Emergency door locked. Ship under attack. Leave or I will make you.
MC: Nonono! Wait a minute. I'm not trying to attack anything! How are you even still functioning, this ship has been floating in space for weeks!
AI: Intruder. Intruder. Leave or I will make you.
MC: Great!... I don't have what's needed to open this door, maybe I can find something elsewhere, but I need to be quick about it.

Scene: Entering engine room in abandoned spaceship

AI: I have warned you. This ship will be your end.

Scene: Engine room after killing everything inside

MC: This is the engine room. There seems to be a floor above me, but how do I get up there?

Scene: Entering cure room in abandoned spaceship

AI: Unauthorized person entering restricted area. Need to protect the cargo.

Scene: Cure room after killing everything inside

MC: This is the lab. If I remember correctly, this ship had a small crew of medical professionals on board. The cure should probably be somewhere around here, but the door to the other side is locked.

Scene: Ult room

MC: Oh god, what the hell is this thing? Is this what killed the crew?

Scene: Ult room after killing the angler fish

MC: It dropped something and my arm sucked it up, it's getting hungrier. Hopefully there is something in here that is useful.
