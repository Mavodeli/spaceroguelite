You arrived on Cryke 2H23 just in time. You decided against entering cryo sleep again for the journey back home, out of fear that you wouldn't wake up again. As a result, the head ache steadily worsened and halfway along the flight you lost all feeling in the infected arm, to the point where you were unable to even lift it up, let alone steer the ship with it. Once you finally entered Cryke's atmosphere, the claw had begun to involuntarily snap at everything around it and by the time they dragged you out of your cockpit you had completely lost any sense of your body and your limbs were thrashing uncontrollably. Shortly after that, you lost consciousness. You open the little yellow strongbox with the evil-looking pictogram. Inside lies a small phial with a strangely blue-ish glowing liquid. 'Well, that's quite convenient!' you think as you uncork it and chug the potion. Immediately you start choking and the infected arm begins thrashing violently. Your throat feels as if you just drank fluid fire and it takes all the willpower you can muster to force the liquid down your gullet. After the most agonizing two minutes of your life the pain finally resides. You might just be imagining it but looking down at your arm you notice that the red swellings appear way smaller than before. Out of curiosity you try to use the parasite's telekinetic ability to push the yellow box away from you and while you still manage to hurl it across the cargo hold of your ship, it certainly responds much more sluggish to your will. Satisfied, you cross the few paces to the cockpit and strap yourself into the flight seat. Of course you are not rid of the parasite yet, but you can't help but feel much more at ease than in a long time as you go through the preflight-check. Despite your fear that half the cure would not be enough to fully heal you or that the amount wouldn't be sufficient for the colony, you still decide to take matters into your own hands. 'I'm technically getting the cure for the colony, so it would be only a matter of time until I received some of it myself, right? Right.' Having justified your decision for yourself you proceed to open the yellow box. Inside lies a small phial with a strangely blue-ish glowing liquid. You open it, pour about a third of the sample into a metal teacup you recently found hidden in a dusty corner of the cargo hold, reseal the phial, put it back into the box and chug the potion in one go before you can question your judgement any further. You then get into the cockpit of your ship and fire up the engine. Time to head home. According to our records, the Gruber Technologies Panther II hyperdrive of your ship has recently sustained severe damage. However, we are pleased to remind you that under the terms of your rental contract you are entitled to a replacement drive from Gruber Technologies' current line of consumer hyperdrives. To claim your replacement drive, simply submit a certified image of your flight records as well as a copy of your valid flight license at the nearest warranty terminal. Currently the estimated waiting time for a consumer-grade replacement drive is 143 years in Intergalactic Standard Space Time. Please note that in accordance with the 2nd Spacecraft Standardization and Interspace Travel Safety Act (rev. SSITS-53376-2/5221) we have to revoke your personal spaceship ensurance if you do not replace the damaged component within the next 7 days. Your next mission comes from the small planet Crye 2H23 where a small team of experts is trying to fight off an infection that is spreading across the planet. You will make your way there and talk to Qarea, a local medical expert that is currently in charge to find a cure for this infection.  Good luck Here are the details we talked about, including an attachment of the last known position of the Asclepius.  Please retrieve a cure that is located aboard the Asclepius that was on the way to us before all communication stopped a few weeks ago. It was a small ship, only manning a small crew and some lab staff. They were supposed to deliver a cure for the parasite that has infected many of our people already. If we don't get our hands on it soon, many of the infected will be too late to be cured.  Qarea It has been several days since your last mission report. Please submit an up-to-date report detailing your current progress at your earliest convenience. Sincerely, Qarea, Chief Scientist on Cryke 2H23 on behalf of the Ministry of Medical Affairs. PS: As you know, when the ministry asks you to submit something 'at your earliest convenience' that this means 'immediately'. I don't care if you are currently having supper or if you are being chased by a Tenebrian destroyer, start writing that report! Also, should you have retrieved the cure by now and are deliberately delaying your return, you will have to explain yourself before an imperial court martial, do I make myself clear? You have missed your end-of-the-day report. Please contact HQ immediately.  This is an automated E-Mail. Do not respond. I know it's only been a day but I miss you already. Sasha does too. I know you're busy but you know we worry. Please check in when you have time. xoxo It's been two days and still no word from you. I know I always worry way too much but this is very unlike you, so please respond. Just a small response back would be great if you are busy. We miss you. xoxo Hey, just wanted to let you know how things are over here :) Not that great actually. The experimental treatments do not seem to have any effect on the parasite so far. Still more and more people are getting sick every day, this morning admin has announced that the housing blocks B and D will be entirely put under quarantine. That's nearly half the colony! Also, at work the management finally decided to comply with the emergency regulations, so now we have to enter the office through those decontamination chambers. It's not as much of a hassle as you might think, the procedure is much like passing an air lock. Anyway, guess that's it for now, how are YOU doing? ...No seriously, get back to me as soon as you read this, I'm kinda starting to worry... Love you! Something strange happened yesterday at the office: around lunch time the head secretary suddenly collapsed right in the middle of a call, limbs thrashing, drooling like crazy, eyes rolling back and everything! Of course that was it for the day, security immediately rushed in, took them to the medical center and everyone who was working in the office at that time was sent home and put under quarantine for two weeks. So, guess I'll be working from home now... Let me tell you, 'home office' hasn't even started, yet I already hate everything about it! Just getting the router to let me use the company's vpn was a real pain but setting up the input pass-through from my keyboard to the cloud hypervisor... I just wish you were here, you're way better with this IT stuff. Also, now that I'm home all the time, Sasha is pulling my sleeve like every five minutes, it's so exhausting but I can't call Judy over bc we're technically under quarantine. So yeah, that's how it is right now... Please get this mission done as soon as possible, we need you here. I need you. It is kind of embarrassing to admit but... I don't get much sleep at the moment. Every night I'm having these thoughts like 'What if something happened to you?' What if you don't come back? Would I be able to care for Sasha all by myself? I know how silly that sounds! You know I'm not the anxious type, I myself have no idea where this is suddenly coming from. It's just... It's been days and you still haven't answered any of my messages, y'know? I've already been to the doctor and he prescribed me some pills that should help me sleep so I guess I'll be fine for now... Oh, before I forget: Sasha asked me to include one of their drawings. In case it's not apparent, it is supposed to depict you fighting off a bunch of Tenebrians. Cute right? Sasha has fallen ill. They took them to the medical center this morning. They were constantly coughing for two days now and began complaining about head ache and nausea yesterday evening. The doctor said it is likely another parasite infection. I am little fatigued myself since I came back home and my shoulder blades feel somewhat stiff, dunno if it's just stress or if I caught something... if it doesn't get better by tomorrow I'll make an appointment for a check-up. I'm begging you, please just get this mission done and come back, I really need you here with me. It's just so much at the moment, I don't know if I'll be able to bear it all... Hey there! I just wanted to let you know that the medication they developed from the cure sample you brought back from the Asclepius is working great. Sasha responded really well to the treatment, they were among the first to receive a dose. By now they are as good as new and I'm on the mend as well. They are asking about you all the time. Yeah, I haven't told them yet. I know I shouldn't put it off like that, I... guess I still haven't completely come to terms with it myself. It feels so unreal y'know? Like, I always imagined the three of us would get through all of this together. That we would live our lives together. I suppose I haven't fully realised that... yeah, that that's it. You're gone, You have moved on without me. And the last thing you did was to save all of us... I'm not even sure I deserve that kind of sacrifice. Anyway, I don't want to end this message on such a heavy note :) I hope you're doing well, where ever you are right now. I hope this other place is nice and that you are happy. I think I should wrap it up for now so... if you can and if it's not too much to ask, wait for me. I wish for us to be reunited again someday, I really do. And if only to tell you about all the things happened in your absence, about how Sasha grew up, how they did in school, about the first partner they brought home and so on. But for now... so long! In accordance with the Imperial Criminal Justice Declaration and the Criminal Prosecution Regulations for Independent Contractors in Service of Imperial Frontier Colonies you have been found guilty and are therefore convicted of (1) theft of imperial property, (2) insufficient fulfillment of contract obligations towards imperial authorities and (3) murder in 1257 cases. All the offenses contained herein of which you were convicted have been added to your criminal record. You currently have at least one conviction or pending charge under imperial law that is not either sealed or expunged, therefore your status as an Imperial Citizen is hereby revoked with immediate effect. Since you are convicted of at least one criminal offense against His Imperial Highness, an arrest warrant as well as a bounty have been issued against you in all systems under expanded imperial juristiction. Since you no longer possess the status of Imperial Citizen, please return any and all items that are considered state property under imperial law in your possession. Failing to do so will result in a charge against you, the amount of which will be determined based on any and all such items in your possession at the time your citizenship was revoked. Please report to your Legal Supervisor to clear your outstanding charges and/or receive punishment for your convictions. For your service to His Imperial Highness in retrieving a cure for the parasite infection that plaques the imperial colony on Cryke 2H23, the Ministry of Medical Affairs has been granted permission and is most pleased to bestow the title of 'Honorary Colonial Subject' upon you. You have furthermore been granted permission to purchase residential property in the Imperial City. To claim the certificate signed by the High Secretary herself and the monetary compensation that come with your new civil status, please visit your Legal Supervisor at your convenience. Sincerely, Qarea, Chief Scientist on Cryke 2H23 on behalf of the Ministry of Medical Affairs. PS: I'm very sorry that on account of your physical condition we cannot meet in person and I hope that this message finds you in a state where you are still able to comprehend its meaning. Your wife passed away half an hour ago. The treatment sadly didn't do much to contain the parasite, the infection had already spread too far by the time you returned with the cure. According to her wishes, we will scatter her cremated remains outside of Cryke's atmosphere, as we did with those of your child. Since you do not have any relative eligible to inherit your possessions, they will be assimilated into colonial property upon your passing. With most of the ship repaired, you can make your way to the position Qarea gave you. Thankfully, it's in close proximity and you won't be needing the missing hyperdrive core to get there. You have the cure in your hands. But what do you do? If  you bring it to the colony now they can grow it, curing their own planat of the parasite and anybody that comes after them. But by then it might be too late for you. Qarea told you to find a cure for the parasite that is plaguing their people. It should be somewhere on the Asclepius. The hyperdrive core went missing somehow. Disregarding how that even happened, a new one has to be found. The windshield is broken. Without it the ship can't go anywhere. Maybe there is something outside that can repair it. There is some silicate floating around but I need to find a way to break them into smaller pieces. Thankfully, this cursed ship at least had a core we can use to get out of there. I should head back and install it. There seems to be something on the second level of the engine room but it's blocked by a broken hatch. I should look for a way to get past. There is no energy left to power the thrusters. I need to find something to recharge them. Luckily, there was some silicate floating around space. With the workbench I should be able to refine it and repair the window. Some parts of the ship are damaged. Let's see if I can find something to repair them. I was able to make some silicone by using the workbench. I can repair the windshield now.     "I should inspect all of the ships' components before heading out.",
    "startRepairSpaceship" : 
    "Judging from all the warnings and error messages the bord computer throws at me the ship took quite the beating when it was pulled out of hyper space. Seems like many smaller components were ripped off when it crashed into some of the smaller asteroids before coming to a halt. It's a miracle that the hull is mostly intact and the artificial atmosphere is still stable. Once I get outside I should have a look around and see what can be salvaged in the vicinity.",
    "completedRepairSpaceship" : 
    "Finally, the minor ship repairs are done. Considering that I slept through most of the engineering lectures at the imperial academy I think I did quite a decent job. Let's get outside and have a quick look at the fruits of my labor.",
    "startRechargeThrusters" : 
    "Ok, that looks really bad. The power plant is completely down, all systems are currently drawing on the emergency generator. I need to find a way to recharge it, the generator won't run forever. Hell, it's not even strong enough to supply the thrusters so I can't move the ship an inch. I knew I shouldn't have gone with the civilian model...",
    "completedRechargeThrusters" : 
    "The power plant is purring like a kitten again. Who would've thought that this crappy black market refinery module would come in handy someday...",
    "startFindSilicate" :
    "Wow, the windshield is pretty badly damaged. Good thing I took the extra effort and scrubbed the security shutters' guide rails before heading out. But with the view obstructed like this there's no way of getting the ship out of the asteroid field in one piece. I have to make some kind of adhesive to seal the cracks in the windshield.",
    "firstTimeSeeingSilicateAsteroidWithUltimate" : 
    "There seem to be large silicate deposits in these asteroids. That's exactly what I need to repair the windshield. Good thing I recently bought that engine-powered refinery module, I can use that to make the adhesive for the windshield. But first I have to collect enough silicate.",
    "firstTimeSeeingSilicateAsteroidWithoutUltimate" : 
    "There seem to be large silicate deposits in these asteroids. This is exactly what I need to repair the windshield. Good thing I recently bought that engine-powered refinery module, I can use that to make the adhesive for the windshield. But first I have to find a way to break down the asteroids into smaller pieces that I can carry back to the ship.",
    "completedFindSilicate" :
    "This should be enough silicate. If I bring it to the engine I can use the refinery module to make the adhesive for the windshield.",
    "completedRefineSilicate" :
    "Got the adhesive. Time to head over to the windshield and seal the cracks.",
    "completedRepairWindshield" : 
    "Ok, that should do it. Still can't believe how incredibly lucky I was to strand right next to those silicate deposits... Mental note: start saving up for one of these reinforced solid windshields with an environmental projection system.",
    "firstTimeSeeingElectroAsteroid" : 
    "Those meteoroids seems to be charged with some kind of energy. If I bring them back to the engine, I should be able use my new refinery module to extract the energy and recharge the ships' power plant.",
    "firstTimeSeeingAttractTwoAsteroid" :
    "Wow, that's a really large piece of rock. It appears to be heavily fractured, maybe it collided with another asteroid... wait, what's that strange glow in the center? Looks like an energy field of some kind? Let's check it out, maybe there is some valuable ore inside.",
    "completedGetAttractTwo" : 
    "What the hell? The parasite seems to have absorbed the energy...",
    "startFindANewHyperdriveCore" : 
    "Apart from that... the shield is only at half capacity 'cause most of the emitters are damaged but the coolers are still running, the hyperdrive looks fine too... wait, where's the hyperdrive core? I mean... how? How is that even possible? That's... not good at all, without the core module the hyperdrive is completely useless. If I ever want to get home, I'll somehow have to find a new hyperdrive core.",
    "completedFindANewHyperdriveCore" : 
    "This hyperdrive core is a truly ancient model, it must be at least twenty years old. But with some tinkering I should be able to mount it on my own hyperdrive.",
    "completedInstallNewHyperdriveCore" : 
    "Ok, installing the hyperdrive core was actually very straight forward. Let's try turning it on... 0 errors and 283 warnings. Great, that means it works! Well, at least it should be enough to get me back home.",
    "HyperdriveCoreIsInstalled" : 
    "The hyperdrive is fully functional again.",
    "protagonistWakesUp" : 
    "Ugh, my head... This doesn't feel like the migraine I usually get from cryo sleep. What happened? Seems like something pulled the ship out of hyper space. I should have a look around, see if anything got damaged...",
    "protagonistInspectsCrabasite" : 
    "Huh? Why does my arm feel so numb all of a sudden? What the... no no no, this can't be!!! They told me I'd be safe, that I wouldn't catch it because of all the precautions they took! FUCK! As if stranding in the middle of nowhere wasn't enough already!",
    "startFindACure" : 
    "Ok, stay calm... it's ok. Deep breaths. You are here to get a cure for this anyway. The only issue is that now I have to find the cure quickly, before the parasite reaches my brain. Just be quick about it... yeah... I just have to hurry.",
    "completedFindACure" : 
    "Finally, I've got my hands, well... hand on the cure. However, I'm quite surprised there's so little of it... I'm not sure how Qarea intends to heal the huge number of infected with this little antidote... But I am not the scientist here, so who am I to judge?",
    "protagonistCollectedAllSpaceshipQuests" : 
    "Now I've got a good overview of the situation. I should head outside and have a look around, see where I am and if I'm lucky, I can find just what I need to fix up the spaceship and continue my mission.",
    "firstTimeLeavingSpaceship" : 
    "Well, that explains a lot. The scanner shows that there is a massive black hole in the vicinity. That's what must've pulled the ship out of hyper space. Talkin' 'bout makin' it quick... if I don't manage to repair the ship in time, that parasite will be the least of my concerns.",
    "firstTimeLeavingSpaceshipContinued" : 
    "Let's have a look around, see if there's anything useful nearby...",
    "firstTimeSeeingSpaceshipParts" : 
    "Some hull sheathing, an antenna and even a whole thruster, those parts look like just what I need to patch up the chassis. I should collect some of it and see what I can cobble together at the workbench.",
    "protagonistCompletedEmergencyRepairs" :
    "Finally. The ship's 'ready for lift-off' again. Well, not really, but the thrusters should be enough to get me to that abandoned spaceship Qarea mentioned. Time to get back into the flight seat.",
    "gameSaved" :
    "Game saved.",
    "completedOpenTheEmergencyDoor" :
    "If you think about it, it's actually kind of intuitive to try and break a lock using this massive crab claw. That ability will surely come in handy further down the line. ...Get it? Ok, ok I'm sorry, I'll stop.",
    "AS_EmergencyDoor_IsNotInteractableMC1" :
    "Shit, how do I get through? I don't have a code or anything. Maybe I should try '1234' or 'password'... ... Alright, that would've been too good to be true.",

    "Oh great...",

    "onAnglerFishDied" :

    "That hatch is shut tight. If I want to get to the Asclepius' hyperdrive, I will have to open it somehow. The hinges look quite rusty, if I push hard enough I should be able to just bust it open.",

    "Ok, now the way to the hyperdrive core should be free.",
    "startTheJourneyHome" : 
    "Now that I have both the cure and a new hyperdrive core, I'm all set to pack up and head home. Let's get to the cockpit and leave this cursed asteroid field for good.",
