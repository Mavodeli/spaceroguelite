Scene: Spaceship after crash

Event: On game start
Dialogue: Ugh... What happened? I should have a look around.

Event: Walking around, checking out the spaceship
Dialogue: I can't see where I am, the window is broken. Also, the ship seems to be running on the emergency generator. I need to find something to charge it. Looking at the hyperdrive, it got destroyed completely because of the malfunction. If I want to get home, I will need to replace it somehow. And lastly, there are small repairs I will need to make around the ship.
Dialogue: I should go outside and see where I am. If I'm lucky, I can find something to fix up the spaceship.

Event: Looks at his arm for the first time when trying to open the door of the spaceship
Dialogue: Huh?...!!! This can't be! They told me I'd be safe, that they had taken all the needed precautions!!! FUCK! As if all this wasn't bad enough already!
Dialogue: It's ok. It's ok. Stay calm. You are here to get the cure for this anyway. Get it quickly, and you'll be able to get cured too. Just make it quick... ye... just need to make it quick.


Scene: Outside the spaceship for the first time

Event: Leaving the spaceship
Dialogue: Now I understand why the spaceship malfunctioned. And no wonder it was in the middle of nowhere. A black hole. Talk about making it quick... If I don't the parasite will be the least of my concerns.
Dialogue: I should have a look around to see if I can find anything useful in these big asteroids.


Scene: Outside the spaceship

Event: Seeing the floating ship wreck parts for the first time
Dialogue: Those parts look perfect to patch up some of the small repairs I need to make around the ship. I should bring them to the workbench.

Event: Seeing the ult meteoroid for the first time
Dialogue: What is this glowing thing in the middle, I should check it out.

Event: Seeing the electrically charged meteoroids for the first time with ult
Dialogue: These strange rocks seem to be charged with some kind of energy, I should be able to charge the ship with it.

Event: Seeing the electrically charged meteoroids for the first time without ult
Dialogue: These strange rocks seem to be charged with some kind of energy, I should be able to charge the ship with it. But I don't have anything to smash them with. I should have a look around for something.

Event: Seeing the silicon meteoroid for the first time
Dialogue: This meteoroid seems to have some silicon inside it. If I bring it back to the workbench, I could use it to repair the glass.


Scene: Inside the spaceship after repairing everything in time

Event: Repaired last ship part in time to make it out
Dialogue: Finally. I have to get out of here before I die. 

Event: After leaving the black hole behind and finding the abandoned spaceship we have been looking for that holds the cure
Dialogue: There it is. Didn't think I would make it this far with all that has happened today, I'm not going to lie. Let's get in there and out before it's too late.


Scene: E-Mails

Event: Finished reading first E-Mail 
Dialogue: Sigh... I need to make it out alive. They need me.
