  description: 'It is kind of embarrassing to admit but... I don''t get much sleep
    at the moment. Every night I''m having these thoughts like ''What if something
    happened to you?'' What if you don''t come back? Would I be able to care for
    Sasha all by myself? I know how silly that sounds! You know I''m not the anxious
    type, I myself have no idea where this is suddenly coming from. It''s just...
    It''s been days and you still haven''t answered any of my messages, y''know?
    I''ve already been to the doctor and he prescribed me some pills that should
    help me sleep so I guess I''ll be fine for now... Oh, before I forget: Sasha
    asked me to include one of their drawings. In case it''s not apparent, it is
    supposed to depict you fighting off a bunch of Tenebrians. Cute right?'
