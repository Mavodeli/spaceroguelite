  description: According to our records, the Gruber Technologies Panther II hyperdrive
    of your ship has recently sustained severe damage. However, we are pleased to
    remind you that under the terms of your rental contract you are entitled to a
    replacement drive from Gruber Technologies' current line of consumer hyperdrives.
    To claim your replacement drive, simply submit a certified image of your flight
    records as well as a copy of your valid flight license at the nearest warranty
    terminal. Currently the estimated waiting time for a consumer-grade replacement
    drive is 143 years in Intergalactic Standard Space Time. Please note that in
    accordance with the 2nd Spacecraft Standardization and Interspace Travel Safety
    Act (rev. SSITS-53376-2/5221) we have to revoke your personal spaceship ensurance
    if you do not replace the damaged component within the next 7 days.
