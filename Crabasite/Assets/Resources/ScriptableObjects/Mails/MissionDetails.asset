  description: Here are the details we talked about including an attachment of the
    last known position of the abandoned spaceship.  Please retrieve a cure that
    is located aboard an abandoned spaceship that was on the way to us before all
    communication stopped a few weeks ago. It was a small ship, only manning a small
    crew and some lab staff. They were supposed to deliver a cure for the parasite
    that has infected many of our people already. If we don't get our hands on it
    soon, many of the infected will be too late to be cured.  Qarea
