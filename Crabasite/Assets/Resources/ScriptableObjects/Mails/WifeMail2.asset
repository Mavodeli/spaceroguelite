  description: 'Something strange happened yesterday at the office: around lunch
    time the head secretary suddenly collapsed right in the middle of a call, limbs
    thrashing, drooling like crazy, eyes rolling back and everything! Of course that
    was it for the day, security immediately rushed in, took them to the medical
    center and everyone who was working in the office at that time was sent home
    and put under quarantine for two weeks. So, guess I''ll be working from home
    now... Let me tell you, ''home office'' hasn''t even started, yet I already hate
    everything about it! Just getting the router to let me use the company''s vpn
    was a real pain but setting up the input pass-through from my keyboard to the
    cloud hypervisor... I just wish you were here, you''re way better with this IT
    stuff. Also, now that I''m home all the time, Sasha is pulling my sleeve like
    every five minutes, it''s so exhausting but I can''t call Judy over bc we''re
    technically under quarantine. So yeah, that''s how it is right now... Please
    get this mission done as soon as possible, we need you here. I need you. '
