  subject: Sasha is ill
  senderName: Katheryne
  description: Sasha has fallen ill. They took them to the medical center this morning.
    They were constantly coughing for two days now and began complaining about head
    ache and nausea yesterday evening. The doctor said it is likely another parasite
    infection. I am little fatigued myself since I came back home and my shoulder
    blades feel somewhat stiff, dunno if it's just stress or if I caught something...
    if it doesn't get better by tomorrow I'll make an appointment for a check-up.
    I'm begging you, please just get this mission done and come back, I really need
    you here with me. It's just so much at the moment, I don't know if I'll be able
    to bear it all...
