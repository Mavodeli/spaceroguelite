  description: 'It has been several days since your last mission report. Please submit
    an up-to-date report detailing your current progress at your earliest convenience.
    Sincerely, Qarea, Chief Scientist on Cryke 2H23 on behalf of the Ministry of
    Medical Affairs. PS: As you know, when the ministry asks you to submit something
    ''at your earliest convenience'' that this means ''immediately''. I don''t care
    if you are currently having supper or if you are being chased by a Tenebrian
    destroyer, start writing that report! Also, should you have retrieved the cure
    by now and are deliberately delaying your return, you will have to explain yourself
    before an imperial court martial, do I make myself clear?'
