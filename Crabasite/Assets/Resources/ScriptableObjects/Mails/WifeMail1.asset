  description: Hey, just wanted to let you know how things are over here :) Not that
    great actually. The experimental treatments do not seem to have any effect on
    the parasite so far. Still more and more people are getting sick every day, this
    morning admin has announced that the housing blocks B and D will be entirely
    put under quarantine. That's nearly half the colony! Also, at work the management
    finally decided to comply with the emergency regulations, so now we have to enter
    the office through those decontamination chambers. It's not as much of a hassle
    as you might think, the procedure is much like passing an air lock. Anyway, guess
    that's it for now, how are YOU doing? ...No seriously, get back to me as soon
    as you read this, I'm kinda starting to worry... Love you!
